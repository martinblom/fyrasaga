Character generator for Ars Magica. Written in Dart and based on
Google AppEngine.

Installation
------------

Start a new Dart WebUI application, git clone this repository,
and move the cloned directory to the `web` subdirectory of the
new application.

For some reason this app seems to need WebUI to be version
`0.4.8+3`. It doesn't run with version 0.4.8+4. Specify that
in your `pubspec.yaml`.
